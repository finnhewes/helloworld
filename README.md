Learning how this works!

I'm 23 years old and not getting any younger!
I'm a long haired, tree hugging hippie, and a brand new developer.

I speak 3 languages moderately well, though I've dipped my toes into many.

I graduated from Northwestern University in June of 2021, and now I walk the earth.
